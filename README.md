# VideoGameRadar
Program that uses Spring and Hibernate to keep track of video game releases. 

Allows you to upload an image of a certain game and input the title, genre and release date.  This is stored in a database using hibernate.  

In order to upload, edit or delete an entry, you need to be logged into an account.  The accounts are simply a username and password that is stored in the h2 database.

All the entries are displayed on the main page with the option to sort and filter in different ways.

Here is a link to a video demo of the site and all of its features.
